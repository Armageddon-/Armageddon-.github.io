<br/><br/>

## Improving the documentation

Documentation is massively important to help users make the most of
{{site.name}} and its probably the area that needs the most help!
<br/><br/>


So if you are interested in helping the documentation effort; whether its
just to fix a page here or there, correct a link or even write a tutorial
or improve what documentation is already there please do dive in and
help!
<br/><br/>

All of the documentation is stored in project source repository, see [How
the Site works](site.html)

## If you find a bug or problem

Please raise a new issue in our [Issue Tracker]({{site.issue_tracker}}). If
you can create a JUnit test case then your issue is more likely to be
resolved quicker. Then we can add your issue to our [source control
system](../source.html) and then we'll know when its really fixed and we can
ensure that the problem stays fixed in future releases.

## Working on the code and creating patches

We gladly accept patches if you can find ways to improve, tune or fix
{{site.name}} in some way.
